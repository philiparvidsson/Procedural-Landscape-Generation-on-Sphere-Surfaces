  \textls{\textsc{abstract}}---Generating planet-like features---e.g., mountains, ridges, valleys
  and oceans---on a sphere is an oft occurring problem encountered in computer graphics, computer
  games and other visualizations of planets, asteroids, rocks and mountains.  Traditionally, a
  heightmap displacement texture is generated using some noise function, then \textsc{uv}-mapped
  onto a sphere surface to give it characteristics of a planet.  In this short paper, a different
  approach is proposed; an algorithm for iteratively generating planet-like features on a sphere
  surface by using randomly oriented planes to split the geometry, and then applying anti-symmetric
  transformations to the two hemispheres.}
