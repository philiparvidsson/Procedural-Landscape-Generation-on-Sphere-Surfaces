It would be interesting to see a raytracer implemented in a functional manner visualizing the
algorithm as iterations are applied.  Implemented on a \textsc{gpu}, it could probably run the
algorithm in real-time.  The idea would be to compute all splits beforehand and then apply them (or
a subset of them) directly in the ray-sphere intersection equation for each pixel.
