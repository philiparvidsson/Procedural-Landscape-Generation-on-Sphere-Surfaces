# What is this?

<img align="right" width="292" src="paper/images/final-render.png" alt="" />

I came up with this algorithm one day on my way home from work. I decided to try it out and I really liked the effects of it, so I wrote a short paper on how it works. ðŸ¤“

## Running the demo

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/philiparvidsson/Procedural-Landscape-Generation-on-Sphere-Surfaces.git`
2. Navigate to the demo directory and run index.html.

Your browser should display a sphere in 3D.  The sphere mesh is very high-resolution so give it a few minutes to complete (the sphere will stop morphing when it's done).

## Video

Here's a video of the algorithm being applied to a low-resolution mesh in real-time:
